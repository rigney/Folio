				<h2 class="noTopMargin hideMe">Executive Summary</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe">In total, 31 usability issues were discovered during the heuristic evaluation of Larky. A majority of the issues relate to the unintuitive placement of information and absence of information important to users - the most severe of which prevents users from exiting a screen.</p>

				<h2 class="hideMe">Introduction</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">This heuristic evaluation of Larky consists of an overview of the evaluation approach, an outline of the target user, and a detailed analysis of the discovered usability issues.</p>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Approach</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">I evaluated Larky against a set of usability heuristics while attempting to complete the core tasks of the application. As the sole evaluator, the list of discovered usability issues is by no means complete. Different people find different usability issues and therefore additional evaluations, each conducted by a separate evaluator following this same approach, are required to make this list exhaustive. </p>

				<h3 class="hideMe">Nielsen and Molich's 10 Heuristics</h3>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">Larky was evaluated against <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</a>. Initially developed in 1990 by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich, later refined by Nielsen in 1994, these heuristics are well-respected and widely used in heuristic evaluations.</p>

				<dl class="first hideMe2">
				  <dt>1. Visibility of system status</dt>
				  <dd>The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</dd>
				  <dt>2. Match between system and the real world</dt>
				  <dd>The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</dd>
				  <dt>3. User control and freedom</dt>
				  <dd>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.</dd>
				  <dt>4. Consistency and standards</dt>
				  <dd>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</dd>
				  <dt>5. Error prevention</dt>
				  <dd>Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.</dd>
				  <dt>6. Recognition rather than recall</dt>
				  <dd>Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.</dd>
				  <dt>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</dt>
				  <dd>Accelerators unseen by the novice user may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</dd>
				  <dt>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</dt>
				  <dd>Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.</dd>
				  <dt>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</dt>
				  <dd>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.</dd>
				  <dt>10. Help and documentation</dt>
				  <dd>Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</dd>
				</dl>

				<h3 class="hideMe">Severity System</h3>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To better understand how the discovered usability issues impact users, I assigned a severity rating to each issue. To keep my findings in line with Nielsen's methodology, I used his severity rating system.</p>

				<ul class="listContent hideMe2">
					<li class="listContentItem"><span class="mediumWeight">No Issue -</span> May conflict with one of the heuristics but isn’t a usability issue.</li>
					<li class="listContentItem"><span class="mediumWeight">Minimal Issue -</span> Is easy for users to overcome and should be given lowest priority to fix. May be a cosmetic issue only.</li>
					<li class="listContentItem"><span class="mediumWeight">Minor Issue -</span> Slightly slows down and irritates users. Should be given low priority to fix.</li>
					<li class="listContentItem"><span class="mediumWeight">Major Issue -</span> Is difficult for users to overcome. Causes significant delay and moderate irritation. May occur often and should be given high priority to fix.</li>
					<li class="listContentItem"><span class="mediumWeight">Catastrophic Issue -</span> Prevents users from completing a task and causes considerable irritation. Is imperative to fix and should block the release of the product.</li>
				</ul>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Target User</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To ensure that my analysis was focused and aligned with the frustrations, behaviors, and goals of Larky’s users I created a proto-persona. It was important for me to be able to empathize with what a user would be thinking, feeling, and doing throughout each task.</p>

				<h3 class="hideMe">Proto-Persona</h3>

				<div class="hideMe2">
		    	<img class="protoPersonaIllustration" src="imgs/protoPersona.png" alt="Face of Proto-Persona">

						<p class="parContent subHeader">A 28 year old High School teacher living in Ann Arbor, MI</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<dl class="first hideMe2">
				  <dt>Behaviors</dt>
				  <dd class="bullet">Frequently makes in-store purchases</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Runs weekly errands</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Carries her membership cards with her but rarely uses them</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Often relies on employees or internet searches to know whether her memberships can earn her a discount on the purchase she is making</dd>
				</dl>

				<dl class="hideMe2">
				  <dt>Frustrations</dt>
				  <dd class="bullet">Constantly misses out on savings opportunities offered by her memberships</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Has no way to track which discounts are offered by her memberships</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Even when she is aware of a discount she doesn’t always know how or when to redeem it</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Asking employees or searching the internet to discover the discounts offered by her memberships is time consuming and not always useful</dd>
				</dl>

				<dl class="hideMe2">
				  <dt>Goals</dt>
				  <dd class="bullet">Is aware of nearby savings opportunities offered by her memberships</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Information regarding her memberships and their offered discounts is reliable and easy to find, track, and store</dd>
				  <dd class="bullet">Knows how to redeem the discounts offered by her memberships</dd>
				</dl>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To determine which tasks against which to evaluate the heuristics I had to understand what tasks Sara would  carry out to accomplish her goals. Therefore, I developed user need statements to translate Sara’s behaviors, frustrations, and goals into statements from which tasks could be derived.</p>

				<h3 class="hideMe">User Need Statements</h3>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To determine which tasks to evaluate the heuristics against, I had to understand what tasks Sara would  carry out to accomplish her goals. Therefore, I developed user need statements to translate Sara’s behaviors, frustrations, and goals into statements that tasks could be derived from.</p>

						<p class="parContent italic">When I know of a discount offered by one of my memberships, I want the details of the discount to be readily available, so that I know when and how to redeem it.</p>

				<h2 class="hideMe">Findings</h2>


				<h3 id="issue1" class="hideMe">1. Absence of friction in the Remove Membership button</h3>

				<div class="imageContainer hideMe2"><img class="interfaceImage" src="imgs/removeMembership.gif" alt="Larky Interface"></div>

				<p class="parContent belowImage hideMe2"><span class="mediumWeight">Recommendation -</span> Require the user to confirm their removal of a membership before the membership is removed. Adding this friction allows users to re-engage with what they are doing and assures them that the decision they are making is actually the decision they want to be making.</p>


				<h3 id="issue2" class="hideMe">2. Inability to undo the removal of a membership</h3>

				<div class="hideMe2">
					<p class="parContent first"><span class="mediumWeight">Task -</span> Maintain a list of memberships</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Heuristic -</span> User control and freedom</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Minimal Issue -</span> After a user removes a membership, they are unable to undo the removal.</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Recommendation -</span> After a user removes a membership, briefly provide them with an undo option.</p>
				</div>


				<h3 id="issue3" class="hideMe">3.  Remove Membership label has the perceived affordance of being tappable when it is not</h3>

					<p class="parContent first"><span class="mediumWeight">Task -</span> Maintain a list of memberships</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Heuristic -</span> Match between system and the real world</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Minor Issue -</span> The proximity of the Remove Membership label to the x icon suggests that the label is a component of the Remove Membership button. Therefore, the label has a perceived affordance of being tappable when it is not.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="imageContainer hideMe2"><img class="interfaceImage" src="imgs/removeMembershipLabel.gif" alt="Larky Interface"></div>

				<p class="parContent belowImage hideMe2"><span class="mediumWeight">Recommendation -</span> Place the Remove Membership label and the x icon in a tappable filled container whose functionality is identical to that of the x icon. Alternatively, remove the x icon, change the Remove Membership label to “Remove”,  and place the Remove Membership label in a tappable filled container whose functionality is identical to that of the x icon.</p>


				<h3 id="issue4" class="hideMe">4. Remove Membership button has a negative affordance of being untappable</h3>

				<div class="hideMe2">
					<p class="parContent first"><span class="mediumWeight">Task -</span> Maintain a list of memberships</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Heuristic -</span> Consistency and standards</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Minor Issue -</span> The Remove Membership button is always active, however, its grey color gives it a negative affordance of being untappable.</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Heuristic -</span> Match between system and the real World</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Minimal Issue -</span> A user’s membership list has an Add Membership button above and below it. Therefore, users must scroll to the top or bottom of the list to add a membership.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="imageContainer hideMe2"><img class="interfaceImage" src="imgs/addMemberships.gif" alt="Larky Interface"></div>

				<p class="parContent belowImage hideMe2"><span class="mediumWeight">Recommendation -</span> Replace the Add Membership buttons with a floating action button on the bottom right corner of the screen. Therefore, users will be able to add a membership regardless of their scroll position.</p>

					<p class="parContent"><span class="mediumWeight">Minor Issue -</span> When a user searches for a membership and gets no search results, they are  prompted to submit a request to have that membership added to Larky. This is a non-immediate solution and carries the assumption that the search term is not misspelled nor will a variation of the search term produce relevant search results.</p>

				<div class="imageContainer hideMe2"><img class="interfaceImage" src="imgs/errorMessage.svg" alt="Larky Interface"></div>

				<p class="parContent belowImage hideMe2"><span class="mediumWeight">Recommendation -</span> Change the error message such that it states there are no search results for the search term (i.e. reminds the user of what they searched), asks the user to check for spelling and change how they phrase the search term (i.e. provides an immediate solution), and provides the user with the option to submit a request to have the membership added to Larky (i.e.  provides an alternative solution).</p>

				<h2 class="hideMe">Conclusion</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">Most of the discovered issues are small, however, together they create a user experience that is unintuitive and that forces an unnecessary cognitive load on users. After finishing this evaluation I sent it to the CEO of Larky and was invited to present my findings to the rest of the team. Although I told them in detail how they could improve the application, it was apparent that their resources were limited and that the application was no longer their highest priority. As a designer you must be aware of your constraints and not only know the user value behind your decisions, but also the business value. Therefore, as a next step I would further prioritize the issues based on the resources that would be required to fix them, the value that would be created for users if they were fixed, and the value that would be created for the business if they were fixed.</p>
