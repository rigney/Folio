				<h2 class="noTopMargin hideMe">Overview</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe">Some children who are in special education for behavioral support are likely to make progress on managing their behaviors. When they do, a transition out of special education can help them continue to build the independence that will improve their long-term outcomes. Strategies for supporting these transitions are not always consistent across classrooms and are difficult to customize to the individual needs of each child. As a result, transitioned students’ self-awareness and self-management of their behavior is not always developed enough for them to navigate the regular classroom with less support and structure.</p>

				<p class="parContent hideMe2">To combat this issue, we want to design a child-centered intervention that is collaboratively reinforced by parents and practitioners. During school, a child would wear a smartwatch to discreetly monitor and catalog their behavior. Using a tablet, practitioners would periodically prompt the smartwatch to display behavioral reminders, tips, and reflective questions. After the child submits answers to the reflective questions, practitioners would review their answers with the child. At the end of each day, practitioners would share a child’s behavioral progress with their parents to promote the reinforcement of positive behaviors at home.</p>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Prior Research</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">In its first iteration, Lilypad was merely a behavioral data collection tool. For two years, it was used by practitioners in 4 classrooms across 3 schools to record and monitor the behavioral progress of students in both special and regular education. During the deployment of Lilypad, Dr. Marcu and other members of the research team conducted naturalistic observation, interviews, and focus groups with practitioners to evaluate the design requirements and constraints of Lilypad. Their research led to the following findings:</p>

				<ul class="listContent hideMe2">
					<li class="listContentItem">Appropriate social behavior should be actively taught and reinforced to students</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">A small number of rules should be clearly communicated and consistently enforced in the classroom</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Students want to be involved with their behavioral data on a daily basis</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Students should receive frequent reminders and feedback on their behavioral progress</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Students should consistently receive positive behavior reinforcers</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Students should understand the connection between receiving rewards and their behavior</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Lilypad should not increase the practitioner's workload</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">Moreover, their research revealed several challenges of transitioning students from special education to regular education. The challenges are as follows:</p>

				<ul class="listContent hideMe2">
					<li class="listContentItem">Oftentimes, students do not have the opportunity to take an <span class="mediumWeight">active role</span> in monitoring their behavior</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">The methods used to track the progress of transitioning students are <span class="mediumWeight">not always consistent</span> across classrooms</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Many class-wide intervention methods are <span class="mediumWeight">difficult to customize</span> to the individual needs of each student</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Special education teachers are <span class="mediumWeight">unsure which methods</span> best monitor and support the progress of transitioning students</li>
				</ul>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Research Question</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">From these challenges, we identified a potential for Lilypad to be more than a behavioral data collection tool. We believed that extending Lilypad’s functionality to put students with special needs at the center of collecting and monitoring their behavioral data could better prepare them for their transition into regular education. To validate and explore this idea, we formed the following research question:</p>

				<p class="parContent hideMe2"><span class="mediumWeight">RQ1 -</span> How can a child-driven intervention support the transition process?</p>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Literature Review</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To address RQ1, we conducted a literature review. Our key findings were as follows:</p>

				<ul class="listContent hideMe2">
					<li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">A child’s behaviors and social skills should be the focus of their intervention</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">A child’s behaviors and social skills are most indicative of their readiness to transition out of the special education classroom (Wilkes et al., 1979).</li>
				    </ul>
				  <li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">An individualized intervention dramatically increases a child’s positive behavior</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">A classroom-wide token economy based on a levels system that was rendered ineffective for two students due to their inappropriate verbalizations was made effective by implementing a self-monitoring intervention (Cavalier et al., 1997). Increasing the individualization provided by the system for students with behavior difficulties resulted in a substantial reduction in inappropriate verbalizations.</li>
				    </ul>
				  <li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">A child’s intervention should nudge them to be their own agent of change</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">One common thread throughout successful game dynamics is that they all work to increase a feeling of agency and ownership in the user (Stott et al., 2013).</li>
				    </ul>
				  <li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">A child’s intervention should promote self-management</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">Self-management, when a student keeps track of their own behavior and takes responsibility for their own behavior, is effective for increasing knowledge, use of self-management behaviours, self-efficacy, responsivity, communication, task performance, and social interaction skills (Koegel et al., 1992; Barlow et al., 2002; Koegel et al., 1999)</li>
				    </ul>
				  <li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">Self-monitoring can positively affect a child’s school and home life</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">Children can benefit from self-monitoring, a subset of self-management, outside of the setting that the self-monitoring procedure is being implemented in (Koegel et al., 1992).</li>
				    </ul>
				  <li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">The benefits of self-monitoring are long lasting</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">Self-monitoring procedures can gradually be faded out and students will continue to self-manage with little to no assistance (Koegel et al., 1999).</li>
				    </ul>
				  <li class="listContentItem mediumWeight">A child can use a smartwatch to quickly and discreetly track their behavioral progress</li>
						<ul class="listInList">
				      <li class="listContentItem">The usage of a smartwatch can be discrete and users are able to view and enter data faster on a smartwatch than on the phone (Årsand et al., 2015).</li>
				    </ul>
				</ul>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Competitive Analysis</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">As result of our literature review, we decided to incorporate a smartwatch into the child-centered intervention. To better understand how smartwatches are being used to track and improve the behavior of their users, we conducted a competitive analysis. Our findings were as follows:</p>

				<ul class="listContent hideMe2">
					<li class="listContentItem">Interactions are minimal and scheduled</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Users can set and edit goals</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Users can quantitatively track their progress</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Users are held accountable and sent reminders when their progress is off track</li>
					<li class="listContentItem">Users are sent motivational tips throughout the day</li>
				</ul>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Interviews</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To further explore our approach and assess the feasibility of using a child-driven intervention to support the transition process, we've been conducting interviews with practitioners, specifically special education teachers and child psychologists.</p>

				<hr class="divider hideMe2">

				<h2 class="hideMe">Target Users</h2>

				<p class="parContent first hideMe2">To help us determine what Lilypad should do and how it should behave, we used our findings from the literature review as well as preliminary findings from the interviews to create personas and empathy maps of the three user groups we’re designing for: children with special needs who are preparing to transition to regular education, parents of those children, and teachers of those children.</p>
